      <h1>Co owning Diya Pool</h1>
      <p>Document Status: in draft.</p>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
	Currently, after the owner have started operating pool for 3 months.
	he sees that it's very hard and nearly impossible to invite people holding ADA to come delegate to the pool.
	<br />
	The reasons for that are
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    In order to mine a block every epoch, the pool needs roughly at lease 1.5M ADA,
	    <br />
	    since we are very small pool with the current stake around 9k, 
	    <br />
	    which that info new delegators or potential delegators will see that, there are no profit
	    staking to this small pool.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Given the first reason above, even if the pool margin fee is set to 0, current delegators
	    are moving out their delegations to another pools.
	    <br />
	    Since this poool could not mine the block regularly every epoch. 
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Given a chance of 0.1% - 0.2% per each epoch to mine a block.
	    The owner can not operate a pool without without loss.
	    <br />
	    The current cost for running the pool is around USD 80 - USD 100 per month.
	  </li>
	</ol>
	Given the above reasons, the pool owner has decided to invite people who own a good amount of ADA to share own the pool.
	<br />
	Once you own a share of the pool, you will get more rewards than other delegators who delegate to the pool,
	<br />
	where the amount of more rewards are given up per the share percentage of the pool.
      </p>
      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <p>
      By owning the DIYA pool shares, you will get special rewards for each epoch the pool mined a block successfully.
      <br />
      The special rewards will be given out in a day or two after the epoch rewards have been given out. 
      </p>
      <h3>How special rewards are calculated</h3>
      <p>
	In every epoch, after the stake pool rewards have been given out to the delegators (this is just normal stake pool reward).
	<br />
	Then, the owner, deducts the cost of running a pool for each epoch from the stake pool fee,
	<br />
	then the owner distributes the rest of the fee to the pool's shareholders, the shareholders will receive the same amount percentage of owning share of remaining fee in ADA.
	<br />
	<br />
	<strong>example</strong>:
	<br />
	Given in the current epoch: The fix fee amount received is 340 ADA (current minimum fee).
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>total_fee = 340 ADA</strong></li>
	  <li><strong>fee_after_deduct_cost = 340 - 10 = 330 ADA</strong> 
	    <br />
	    * deduction of 10 ADA is approximation based 2USD = 1 ADA.
	    <br />
	    * in one month there is roughly 6 epochs, so to cover cost of 100 USD per month. 10 ADA is deducted each epoch
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Now if you own 10% share of DIYA pool
	    <br />
	    <strong>your additional rewards will be = 10% of 330 = 33 ADA</strong>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <h2>How?</h2>
      In order to allow people to own shares of the pool, there will be a total <strong>1,500,000 (<i>one million and five hundred thousand shares</i>)</strong> shares in total.
      <h3>Share Distributions</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>5% (75,000 shares) are owner reserve shares</li>
	<li>95% (1,425,000 shares) are co-owners' shares</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How can I own some shares</h3>
      <p>In order to own some amount of shares you must agree to deligate the same amount of ADA as a minimum amount of ADA to <i>DIYA</i> pool, during the term as per written below in the following section.</p>
      <h2>Terms</h2>
      <p>Co owning contract time: 1 year term, i.e., <strong>starts: July 1, 2021</strong>, <strong>ends: July 31, 2022</strong></p>
